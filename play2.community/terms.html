                    </p>



                    <p><strong>1. Eligibility</strong></p>

                    <p>(a) To open a Play2World Wallet, you may be required to go through a regulatory onboarding process, which may involve providing information for the purposes of identity verification and the detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime in accordance with our AML Policy from time to time. Examples of information we may request may include but are not limited to, information such as incorporation documents of legal persons, registered address, email address, tax identification number, source of wealth/funds, and identity information of ultimate beneficiary owners and directors.

If any of this information changes, you must update as soon as possible with the correct information. You must comply with our AML Policy at all times and from time to time, we may also require you to provide further information as a condition for continued use of the Services and you agree to provide us with the information we request.

                    <p>(b) To access your Play2World Wallet and any associated Services you may be required to download a separate Play2World Token app and link it to the Play2World Wallet using the Play2WorldCoin app via the area made available to you in the Play2WorldCoin app for that purpose.

                    <p><strong>4. The Play2World Wallet</strong></p>



                    <p>The Play2World Wallet allows you to receive, and store Play2World. The Play2World Token is built on the Near protocol and is subject to the terms and conditions of the Near protocol, operated by the Near Foundation (“Near”) from time to time which can be found at Near.org.</p>



                    <p>(a) We reserve the right to provide support for specific cryptocurrencies (“Supported Cryptocurrencies”). For the avoidance of doubt, at the date of these Terms, the only Supported Cryptocurrency is Play2World. Information relating to the Supported Cryptocurrencies will be published on the Play2World Economy Sites from time to time. We may change the Supported Cryptocurrencies from time to time without notice to you, in this case, if we withdraw support for a Supported Cryptocurrency we will notify you to make withdrawals within 10 (ten) days. After this period, the balance will be unavailable for withdrawal. Under no circumstances should you attempt to carry out a Play2World Wallet transaction in relation to a cryptocurrency other than a Supported Cryptocurrency. Before completing any Play2World Wallet transaction, you should therefore ensure that the cryptocurrencies are current in the list of Supported Cryptocurrencies. In particular, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you accept and agree that you will have no access, entitlement or claim:</p>



                    <div class="terms_iIshnL__bnYt_">
                        <p>(i) to any cryptocurrency sent to a receive address associated with your Play2World Wallet where that cryptocurrency is not a Supported Cryptocurrency; or</p>



                        <p>(ii) to any cryptocurrency sent to a receive address associated with your Play2World Wallet, where that receive address is associated with another cryptocurrency. For example, you will have no access, entitlement or claim to any Play2World Tokens (Play2World) sent to a Bitcoin (BTC) receive address or vice versa.</p>



                        <p>(b) We will process Play2World Wallet transactions in accordance with these Terms. You accept and agree that neither Play2World nor Near, does or can:</p>



                        <div class="terms_iIshnL__bnYt_">
                            <p>(i) guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, or other parties to a Play2World Wallet transaction. You are solely responsible for ensuring all whitelisted addresses or Third Party Service transaction details are correct, and you should carefully verify all transaction information prior to submitting transaction instructions to Play2World and you acknowledge that entering incorrect transaction instructions to Play2World may result in loss to you for which Play2World has no liability;</p>



                            <p>(ii) have any control over, or any liability in relation to, the delivery, quality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may buy from or sell to any third party. Play2World shall not be responsible for, and will take no action in relation to, ensuring that any buyer or seller you transact with using your Play2World Wallet completes the relevant transaction or has the requisite authority to do so;</p>



                            <p>(iii) have control nor does Play2World accept any liability in respect of any underlying blockchain network issues, including but not limited to forks, double spends and 51% attacks.</p>



                            <p>(c) You may receive Supported Cryptocurrency into your Play2World Wallet by providing the sender with a receive address of your Play2World Wallet. Your Play2World Wallet will only be credited with the Supported Cryptocurrency sent to a receive address of your Play2World Wallet and associated with that Supported Cryptocurrency. For example, your Play2World Wallet will be credited with Play2World when it is sent to a Play2World receive the address of your Play2World Wallet. Likewise, the Play2World Wallet will only allow the sending of Supported Cryptocurrency to other wallets previously registered by you on the Play2World Platform, which will depend on KYT analysis and Play2World approval.</p>



                            <p><strong>5. Interaction with and Links to Third Party Products and Services</strong></p>



                            <p>The Play2World Sites, your Play2World Wallet, or the Services may contain or enable you to interact with links to third-party websites, mobile software applications, products and services that are not owned or controlled by Play2World (each, a “Third Party Service”). We are not responsible for the content, the security, or the privacy practices of such Third Party Services. You must read and agree to the terms and conditions, and privacy policy of each Third Party Service that you choose to interact with or use and Play2World can accept no responsibility for any Third Party Service.</p>



                            <p><strong>6. Mobile Services</strong></p>



                            <p>To the extent that you access the Services through a mobile device, your wireless service carrier’s standard charges, data rates, and other fees may apply.

In the event that you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you agree to promptly update your Play2World Wallet information (including to ensure that your messages are not sent to any person who might acquire your old number).</p>



                            <p><strong>7. Right to Change/Remove Features or Suspend/Delay Transactions</strong></p>



                            <p>(a) We reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time, including hours of operation or availability of any feature, without notice and without liability.</p>



                            <p>(b) We may decline to process any transaction using the Services (for example, withdrawals) without prior notice and may limit or suspend your use of one or more Services at any time, in our sole discretion. Suspension of your use of any of the Services will not affect your rights and obligations pursuant to the Terms. Where possible, including where we are permitted by law to do so, we will notify you if we decline to process a transaction using the Services by the end of the business day on which the transaction was initiated and, if possible, we will provide our reasons for doing so together with information about anything you can do to correct any errors leading to the stoppage.</p>



                            <p><strong>8. Restricted Activities</strong></p>
